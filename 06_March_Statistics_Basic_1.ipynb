In other words, the level of measurement helps researchers to identify the appropriate statistical procedures and tests to use when analyzing data. Using the wrong statistical procedure for a given level of measurement can result in misleading or inaccurate conclusions.\n",

        "For example, let's consider a study that examines the relationship between income and job satisfaction among employees in a company. The income variable is a ratio-level variable because it has a true zero point (no income) and equal intervals between values. In contrast, job satisfaction is an ordinal-level variable because it has a specific order or rank, but unequal or non-meaningful differences between categories. If the researcher were to use a correlation analysis to examine the relationship between these two variables, the result would be incorrect because correlation is only appropriate for ratio-level variables. Instead, a more appropriate statistical test for analyzing the relationship between a ratio-level and ordinal-level variable would be a chi-squared test or a t-test.\n",
